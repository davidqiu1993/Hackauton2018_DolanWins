Adapted Performance Assessment For Drivers Through Behavioral Advantage.


## Abstract

The potential positive impact of autonomous driving and driver assistance 
technologies have been a major impetus over the last decade. On the flip side, 
it has been a challenging problem to analyze the performance of human drivers 
or autonomous driving agents quantitatively. In this work, we propose a generic 
method that compares the performance of drivers or autonomous driving agents 
even if the environmental conditions are different, by using the driver 
behavioral advantage instead of absolute metrics, which efficiently removes 
the environmental factors. A concrete application of the method is also 
presented, where the performance of more than 100 truck drivers was evaluated 
and ranked in terms of fuel efficiency, covering more than 90,000 trips 
spanning an average of 300 miles in a variety of driving conditions and 
environments.
